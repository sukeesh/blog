INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS
The past half-century has witnessed an explosion in electronics and communications. Our world has been transformed as the transistor-based technologies have given rise to new modes of information storage, processing, and transmission, vital to enhanced productivity, improved health care, and better transportation systems. These technologies are abundantly evident as supermarket scanners, fax machines, word processors, automatic teller machines, and many other "essentials" of modern life. Silicon and software are legitimately most clearly associated with these advances, but other materials, including polymers, play an essential supporting role, which is growing in importance. Owing to their high performance, manufacturing flexibility, quality, and low cost, polymers are key factors. The role of polymers is predicted not only to increase in quantitative terms, but also, more importantly, to extend into new areas in which polymers have not been employed in the past.

Historically, polymeric materials have been applied mainly as insulators and packaging. These uses often involve substantial quantities of material, for example, several hundred million kilograms for cable production annually, and they will remain important for the long-term future. In these applications, polymers offer ease and economy of manufacture, tough, durable mechanical properties, and excellent dielectric properties (i.e., low dielectric constant and loss). Polymers are unlikely to be challenged in these areas. Polyethylene is consistently the material of choice for most communication and power cables, but fluorinated and other polymers are becoming increasingly important for special applications, such as inside wiring where flammability considerations are paramount.

Over the last 20 years, polymers (and other organic materials) have been developed that exhibit electrical and optical properties that were formerly found only in inorganic materials. Polymers have been found that are piezoelectric, conduct electricity electronically, exhibit second-and third-order nonlinear optical behavior, and perform as light-emitting diodes. Optical wave guides, splitters, combiners, polarizers, switches, and other functional devices have been demonstrated. In addition, lithographic pattern formation by the interaction of polymers with ultraviolet (UV) light and other forms of radiation has been carried to amazing levels of resolution and practicality and is the basis for fabrication of integrated and printed circuits of all kinds.

In this section, some of these more exotic properties of polymers are briefly described. For many of these materials, applications are only now being developed. It is likely that the new applications will have specialty niche markets, unlike the massive present market of commodity polymers. The economic factor

driving their production will be quality; small quantities of carefully controlled materials will be produced at high unit costs. These products will be sold by function, not weight.

Conclusions

The foregoing examples illustrate the breadth of application of advanced polymeric materials in applications that are not generally recognized. In these applications, the polymer is in some sense the active element that plays the central role. No other class of materials can rival its range of properties, flexibility in processing, and potential for low cost. Quality of performance is an essential and challenging feature that is being demonstrated by polymeric materials in an impressive array of applications. And the polymer revolution in this arena is just beginning.

The importance of polymers in advanced technology is a key factor in the future of materials development, as indicated in the following applications:

Polymer dielectrics in electronics offer the basis for the smallest circuits and the highest speed of operation.

Conducting polymers have been commercialized in rechargeable batteries and offer the greatest promise for high energy storage with low weight.

Polymer sensors exist for chemical species, thermal and acoustic radiation, temperature, pressure, humidity, ionizing radiation, electric charge, and more.

Buildings can be equipped with a network of optical fibers linking remote locations with a management console. The polymer sensors can be built into the optical fibers to report the presence of toxic gases or to turn off unneeded lights to conserve energy.

Implanted sensors can detect the glucose level in blood and call for insulin injections by means of an implanted pump, as needed.

Electromagnetic shielding will become increasingly necessary, and conducting polymers offer solutions that are conveniently fabricated in complex shapes.

Polymer resists are the basis for the microlithography that makes integrated circuit electronics possible. They are also the basis for the emerging field of micromechanics, which could produce machines smaller than a human cell.

High-density information storage is available through compact disk technology, and improved polymers will improve the performance of this medium. In the future, polymer-based holographic devices could revolutionize the storage and manipulation of information.

Polymers offer solutions to critical economic problems facing the introduction of photonics, the light analog of electronics. The couplers, splitters, and other elements of photonic "circuit boards" all admit to polymeric solutions that may provide the economic breakthrough needed for the photonic revolution. Broad-band communications can be brought directly to the home and office by polymer or glass fibers, using polymeric photonic circuits.

"Smart" windows based on polymeric materials could reflect light when the sun is too bright and transmit light when it is not.

The fabrication of liquid crystal display devices for computers and television can be facilitated and the robustness of the product enhanced by the incorporation of conductive, transparent polymer films.

Light-emitting diodes based on flexible polymeric films have been fabricated and are likely to find diverse applications in the future.

Electrophotography is now based on polymeric photoactive materials, and these have made possible many improvements, such as compact and convenient machine architecture, durability of machines, and long-term print quality.

Polymers are now the recording medium of choice for holography in many applications. This technology offers the promise of ultrahigh-density information storage.

The field is flourishing, and the future is bright. The United States must participate vigorously in this emerging area, from research to development to
