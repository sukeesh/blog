Hi, I'm Sukeesh.

I am a budding Software Developer and Metallurgy undergrad at IIT Roorkee. 

I have a keen interest in solving real life problems with _For_ loops.

I'm interested in Competitive Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval and everything else including _Pizzas_.

Whenever I'm not hitting my system's keypad, I can be found doing anything. For example, travelling through the vast repository of repositories in [Github](http://github.com/sukeesh) or [clicking random stuffs](https://www.instagram.com/sukeesh/) around me or browsing [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sukeesh).

I maintain a post on my setup at [/setup](/setup).

I maintain a project list at [/projects](/projects).

I push most of my code to [Github](http://www.github.com/sukeesh).

I can be stacked on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sukeeshbabu) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sukeesh/).

You can email me on vsukeeshbabu[at]gmail[dot]com
