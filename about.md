I'm Sukeesh as is obvious. A final year undergrad at IIT Roorkee.

I love coding in any form, and Linux, anything about it. You *should* look at [my Github account](https://github.com/sukeesh).

Ping me via [email](mailto:vsukeeshbabu@gmail.com) or on IRC, where I hangout as `sukeesh` or `_sukeesh` on `freenode`.
