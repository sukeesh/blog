**Laptop Setup**:

1. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch) , 128GB SSD, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, Intel HD graphics 6000 1536 MB.

**E-Reader:** Amazon Kindle 

**Mobile**:

1. [Moto G4 Plus](http://www.motorola.in/products/moto-g-plus). I absolutely love it. It has a great camera and performance, at par with the flagships, if not better.

**Audio**:

For listening to music I have a subscription of Wynk music. I extensively use its listen offline feature on mobile. Apart from last.fm, I use Youtube on desktop.
