Those were the days when I wanted to build an application but I had no idea on how. I only knew only C++ back then.

I had an awesome senior [Ravi](https://www.facebook.com/ravikishore1993) who guided and taught me many things. He asked me to start-off by creating a simple chrome extension which opens a new tab. I had no idea on how to do. So, I started googling. Then I found some stackoverflow links, from where I copied some bits of code and modified it and It worked! I was soo excited even though It was a small 3 lines of code. 

He then said to me that Development is just basically googling documentation of things and copy paste of code. It is to be able to make something creative with simple and bad code, which anyone can do by googling stuff.

Here is my repository of that extension.<br>
