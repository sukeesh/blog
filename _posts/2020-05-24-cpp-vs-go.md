Comparing a Sieve of Eratosthenes in Golang vs C++! (Two of my most favourite programming languages)

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

The intention of this post is not to explain the algorithm. You can read more about [it here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

## Code

Code Implementation in both the languages

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)
- Processor 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9
- Memory 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4


## Results!

I tested this code using the time function in a zsh shell.<br>

<b>Example usage of time function</b>

```bash
$ time ./a.out 4194304
./a.out 4194304  0.05s user 0.00s system 95% cpu 0.057 total
```

I tested by generating [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, .... , 4194304] Prime numbers in both the programming languages. Here is how they performed. 

Until 131072, C++ was performing slightly better than Go. But, later Go started dominating and the curve went exponential.
